# ISEN-Java-ContactAPP
Final project

- Setup database using .sql scripts provided at src/main/resources.
- All classes corresponding to a .fxml file could have been extending a parent class, to reduce similar code (init methods).
- Database shouldn't change outside application while it's running.
- Search feature isn't implemented.
